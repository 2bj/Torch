# Illuminate Slim

Using a bare Slim project to test out bootstraps for Illuminate packages.

## Usage
At the moment, the project is divided into many directories beneath public which will each contain a Slim index file. Navigate to that directory in your terminal and run the following to serve a web site from that directory:

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser to view the output of each.
